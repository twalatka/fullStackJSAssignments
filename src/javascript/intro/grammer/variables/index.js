// export var message = 'hello';

// export let greeting = 'Yo!';

// export const saying = 'What up';

// message = 'world';
// greeting = 'Hello';
// // saying = 'Booyah'; cannot change a constant

// OBSERVATIONS
// 1. Var vaiables have their scocpe in the entire closing function, to all the sub-blocks within the closing function.  
//     Let has its scope only within the sub-blocks within the closing funtion of the code. 
// 2. You can update or change a Let variable, a Const cannot be changed, hence the reason it is called a Constant.
// 3. Const should be used if you want your code to remain unchanged, Let will not protect your variable value, use Let when you 
//    are ok with allowing the value of the variable to be changed.
